 * A REDIRECT, not a render: this runs on the server for a document request and
 * in the browser for a client navigation, so the app user reaches the
 * dispatcher's page with the right status either way, without waiting on
 * JavaScript. `redirectDocument` forces a real navigation rather than an
 * in-router one — the dispatcher owns this path, so the app must let go of it.
