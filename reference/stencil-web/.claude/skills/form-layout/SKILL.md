  Lays out forms, onboarding, checkout, settings, and any screen with 3+
  input fields. Enforces single-column layouts, label-above-input, blur-time
  validation, save/submit feedback (pending → success → error), multi-step
  wizards split at logical seams whose drafts survive reload and Back with a
  resume path, and 44px touch targets. Use when designing or coding any
  form-bearing UI, and for fixes like "I lost my progress" or a wizard that
  restarts from step 1.

## When to use

Trigger this skill for any of:

- Forms with 3 or more input fields (sign-up, contact, profile, billing).
- Multi-step wizards or onboarding flows.
- Checkout flows (cart → address → payment → confirm).
- Settings or preferences screens.
- Any modal or sheet that collects structured input.

## Rules

1. **Single column by default.** Use a single-column layout for forms with 8 or fewer fields. Two columns are only allowed for fields that are obviously paired and read together (first/last name, city/state/ZIP, expiry month/year). Never split unrelated fields side by side.
2. **Labels above inputs.** Place the label on its own line above the input, left-aligned. Never use the placeholder as the label — placeholders disappear on focus and break accessibility.
3. **Placeholder is example data only.** Show the format you expect (`jane@example.com`, `MM/YY`), not a restatement of the label.
4. **Inline validation on blur.** Validate a field when the user leaves it, never on every keystroke. On submit, re-run all validators as a safety net and scroll the first error into view.
5. **A save must report its outcome.** An explicit save/submit is a round trip, and the control must reflect all three states of it. While the write is in flight, show a pending state (e.g. label → "Saving…") and block a second submit; assert success only *after* the action resolves ok (an inline "Saved", a checkmark, or a toast); on failure, surface the error at the form, with the entered values still on screen and resubmittable. Never ship a save button that looks identical before and after the press — the person cannot tell a working save from a broken one. This is about explicit saves; a field that autosaves continuously as you type shows a quiet "Saved" tick, never a blocking pending button.
6. **Put the save control where the eye lands, consistently.** Place the primary save/submit at the end of the section it saves, and keep it in the same position on every page of the app. A save button that sits top-right on one screen and bottom on the next reads as "nothing to save here."
7. **Multi-step wizards split at logical seams.** Account info → shipping → payment → confirm. Keep each step ≤ 7 fields. Show a persistent progress indicator (steps + current position) at the top of every step.
8. **44 px minimum touch target on mobile.** Inputs, buttons, and tap-able rows must be ≥ 44 px tall on mobile viewports.
9. **Required-field indicator: pick one and stay consistent.** Either an asterisk after every required label or an explicit "(required)" suffix. Do not mix the two within a project.
10. **Never ask for the same data twice.** Provide a "Same as shipping address" toggle. Pre-fill from social-login profile data, address autocomplete, or saved payment methods whenever available.

## Multi-step flows persist their draft

A wizard whose draft lives only in React state loses everything on reload, Back, or leaving the screen — with no way back in. For any flow of two or more steps:

- **The current step lives in the URL** (a path segment or `?step=2`), so reload and Back land on the same step with its data, never on step 1.
- **The draft outlives the tab.** Persist entered data as steps complete — a server-side draft record for signed-in flows, sessionStorage only for anonymous ones.
- **Offer a visible way back in.** While a draft exists, the flow's entry point shows a "Resume" path ("Resume setup — step 2 of 3") instead of silently starting over.
- **A late async job merges, never overwrites.** When a background job (matching, enrichment, generation) finishes after the app user has edited the draft, write only into fields they haven't touched — replacing the whole draft throws their edits away.

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Stack labels above inputs.
- Trigger validation on `blur` and again on submit.
- Reflect submission state on the save button: pending while in flight, confirmed on success, error at the form on failure.
- Return a discriminable result from the action (`{ ok: true }` / `{ ok: false, error }`), not a bare 200 — the form can only confirm what the action tells it.
- Group related fields into a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>`.
- Disable the submit button only after the user has interacted; otherwise show the error inline.
- Allow paste in OTP, password, and verification fields.

**Don't**
- Don't put labels inside inputs as placeholders.
- Don't validate on every keystroke (annoying), unless it's password strength meter feedback.
- Don't ship a save button whose appearance never changes when pressed.
- Don't confirm a save before the write resolves — "Saved" is a claim about a completed write, not about a click.
- Don't disable the submit button by default — users can't tell why nothing happens.
- Don't auto-advance focus between fields unless the field has a fixed width (OTP digits).
- Don't surface "Please fill out this field" on a field the user hasn't touched.

## Code patterns

Single-column form scaffold:

```html
<form class="grid gap-4 max-w-md">
  <div class="grid gap-1.5">
    <label for="email" class="text-sm font-medium">Email <span aria-hidden="true">*</span></label>
    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required
           placeholder="jane@example.com"
           class="h-11 px-3 rounded-md border" />
    <p class="text-xs text-red-600 hidden" data-error="email"></p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3">
    <div class="grid gap-1.5">
      <label for="first" class="text-sm font-medium">First name *</label>
      <input id="first" name="first" required class="h-11 px-3 rounded-md border" />
    </div>
    <div class="grid gap-1.5">
      <label for="last" class="text-sm font-medium">Last name *</label>
      <input id="last" name="last" required class="h-11 px-3 rounded-md border" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <button type="submit" class="h-11 rounded-md bg-blue-600 text-white">Continue</button>
</form>
```

Blur-time validation hook:

```ts
input.addEventListener('blur', () => {
  const error = validate(input.value);
  errorEl.textContent = error ?? '';
  errorEl.classList.toggle('hidden', !error);
  input.setAttribute('aria-invalid', error ? 'true' : 'false');
});
```

Save that reports its own outcome — a settings form that stays on the page.
`useFetcher` submits without navigating, so the entered values survive a failed
save and can be resubmitted. The action returns `{ ok }` for the form to read.

```tsx
import { useFetcher } from "react-router";

export async function action({ request, context }: Route.ActionArgs) {
  const form = await request.formData();
  try {
    await saveSettings(context, form); // patch only the fields the form manages
    return { ok: true as const };
  } catch {
    return { ok: false as const, error: "Couldn't save — your changes are still here." };
  }
}

export default function Settings() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher<typeof action>();
  const saving = fetcher.state !== "idle";
  const result = fetcher.data;
  return (
    <fetcher.Form method="post" className="grid gap-4 max-w-md">
      {/* fields — their values remain on a failed save */}
      <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
        <button type="submit" disabled={saving}
                className="h-11 rounded-md bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 disabled:opacity-60">
          {saving ? "Saving…" : "Save settings"}
        </button>
        {!saving && result?.ok && <span role="status" className="text-sm text-green-600">Saved</span>}
        {!saving && result?.ok === false && <span role="alert" className="text-sm text-red-600">{result.error}</span>}
      </div>
    </fetcher.Form>
  );
}
```

For a submit that navigates on success (a wizard step, a create flow), use
`useNavigation()` instead: `navigation.state === "submitting"` drives the same
pending label, and the loader of the destination confirms the result.

Wizard progress indicator:

```tsx
<ol className="flex items-center gap-2 text-xs">
  {steps.map((step, i) => (
    <li key={step.id} className={i === current ? 'font-semibold' : 'text-muted-foreground'}>
      {i + 1}. {step.label}
    </li>
  ))}
</ol>
```
